# Sprint 2

## Sprint Goal

- A fully navigable and technically operable website
- A functional database of example courses, schedules, tutorials, and other relevant info
- A user account registration and login system
- An information recording system that saves user data to their account for later access

## Difficulty Spikes

- All devs had different priorities over reading week and weren't able to coordinate their efforts as easily
- CSC301 A2 is due date shortly after Sprint 2, causing all devs to partition their focus
