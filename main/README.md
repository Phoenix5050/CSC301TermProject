## GitHub Developer Submission Procedure
Assuming the [Team FTA GitHub repo](https://github.com/UTMCSC301/project-full-throttle-axolotl.git) has been cloned to your machine:

1. Move all new/updated deliverable files into your local repo clone
2. Create a new GitHub branch named with this convention: s#-[name]-[FUL-#]

    a. **s#**: Current Sprint #

    b. **[name]**: Your own name; lowercase
    
    c. **[FUL-#]**: The Jira issue for which you are submitting changes
    
    _(e.g. A branch from Gordon for Sprint 1 would look like_ **s1-gordon-FUL-1**_)_

3. Move your local changes over to the branch you just created
4. Write a meaningful description of what is accomplished in your changes
    - Bullet point form is fine; use “~” to separate each main detail
5. Fetch the latest origin and merge any conflicting files if necessary
6. Commit your changes to your new branch
7. Publish your branch to the [project-full-throttle-axolotl repo](https://github.com/UTMCSC301/project-full-throttle-axolotl.git)
8. From there, create a pull request for your new branch
9. Merge the pull request into the master branch, then safely delete your branch

[Take a look at this example commit made for reference](https://github.com/UTMCSC301/project-full-throttle-axolotl/commit/f1440740c1be42800cdd1e85d1000534c0b0bdfc).

When you merge, make triple-sure that your code works and you don’t include anything you don’t mean to.

And above all…

## ***DON’T BREAK THE BUILD!***
